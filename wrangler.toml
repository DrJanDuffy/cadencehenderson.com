# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Attach this Worker to multiple hostnames (one script, many routes):
#
# (A) Dashboard: Workers & Pages → this Worker → Settings → Routes → Add route
#     e.g. *example.com/*, *another.com/* (one route per domain).
#
# (B) In wrangler.toml, uncomment and set routes (zone must be in same account):
#     routes = [
#       { pattern = "example.com/*", zone_name = "example.com" },
#       { pattern = "another.com/*", zone_name = "another.com" },
#     ]
