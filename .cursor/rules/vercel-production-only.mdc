# Vercel: production only, skip preview

## When to apply

When deploying to Vercel, triggering a deploy, or when the user asks to deploy or push to production.

## Requirement

- **Deploy straight to production.** Do not use or rely on the preview environment for this project.
- Use **`vercel --prod`** (or equivalent) so the deployment targets the production environment and skips creating a preview deployment.
- When suggesting deploy commands or CI/CD steps, always use production deployment (e.g. `vercel --prod`, or Vercel project setting: production branch = main and do not promote previews).

## Notes

- Preview deployments (per-PR or per-commit preview URLs) are not required; the user wants changes to go live to production.
- If using Vercel CLI: `vercel --prod` deploys to production; `vercel` without `--prod` creates a preview.
