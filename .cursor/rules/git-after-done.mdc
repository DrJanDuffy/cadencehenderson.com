# Git after task completion

## When to apply

When you have finished implementing a task, plan, or set of changes (e.g. all to-dos completed, feature done, or user says "when done").

## Requirement

After completing the work:

1. Run **git add** (stage all relevant changes: `git add -A` or stage specific files).
2. Run **git commit** with a clear, concise message describing what was done.
3. Run **git push** to update the remote.

Do not skip these steps unless the user explicitly asks not to commit/push, or there are no changes to commit.

## Notes

- Prefer committing only project-tracked files (e.g. exclude `.agents/`, `.cursor/skills/` install trees if they are not meant to be versioned).
- Commit message should be descriptive (e.g. "Add skills workflow sync and engagement CTAs" not "Updates").
